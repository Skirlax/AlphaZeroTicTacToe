# AlphaZeroTicTacToe

This is an implementation of the DeepMind's AlphaZero algorithm for the game of Tic Tac Toe.

This implementation is partially based on the [alpha-zero-general](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) repository and [DeepMind's AlphaZero paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ).

Right now, **this implementation is not thoroughly tested 
and it's not well optimized for speed**. 

I am also currently in the process of searching 
hyperparameters. **Once the parameters are found and the 
model is trained, I'll provide a model file that can be 
downloaded and reused.**


## Usage
Will be provided once this implementation is ready for use.
